# Unlocking the Full Potential of MRI with Advanced Quantitative Imaging

The Deep Compressed Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DCQMRI) project started in March 2023, 
under the leadership of [Mohammad Golbabaae](https://mgolbabaee.wordpress.com/).

We are developing innovative computational solutions to address a critical limitation in current MRI technology—its lack of quantitative, standardized measurements. 
While MRI is the gold standard for noninvasive, high-resolution imaging, conventional scans cannot be easily compared across hospitals or time points, limiting 
their diagnostic precision. Our research focuses on advancing quantitative MRI (qMRI), which provides reproducible measurements of tissue properties and has the 
potential to transform MRI into a precise scientific tool. However, qMRI’s long scan times have hindered its widespread clinical adoption. To overcome this, 
we are collaborating with world-leading partners, including GE Healthcare, University of Zurich, IRCCS Stella Maris, and University College London. 
Together, we are leveraging advanced deep learning methods for compressed sensing to significantly reduce scan times, making qMRI faster and more practical 
for routine clinical use. By enhancing both image acquisition and reconstruction processes, we aim to turn existing MRI systems into powerful tools for standardized, 
quantitative imaging that can be seamlessly applied across clinical sites, patients, and time points—unlocking new possibilities for precision diagnostics 
and patient monitoring.
